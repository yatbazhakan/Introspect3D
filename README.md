# Introspect3D

**Work In Progress** ðŸš§

This repository contains ongoing research and development on **Introspection for Object Detection in Automated Driving Systems (ADS)**. The main focus of this work is to identify false-negatives or performance drops  of 2D/3D object detection by employing introspection techniques, leveraging neural activation patterns from multiple layers of deep neural networks (DNNs).

## Project Overview

Object detection plays a critical role in the safety of ADS. The aim of this project is to develop a **runtime error detection** mechanism that improves the reliability and performance of object detectors in real-world scenarios.

### Current Features:
- **Neural Activation-Based Introspection**: Monitors the detection performance by analyzing the neural activation patterns across different network layers.
- **Early Layer Activations**: Focuses on using earlier network activations to capture errors more effectively.
- **Object and Spatial Filtering**: Introduces a mechanism to filter out non-critical objects to improve error detection performance.

### What's Coming Next:
- **Documentation** and **Code Cleanup** to make the repository more user-friendly.
- **Testing and CI Integration** to maintain code quality.

## Usage

This project is still in an early development stage, and the setup instructions, examples, and documentation will be updated as we progress.
